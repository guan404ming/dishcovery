- We have created a community-driven platform dedicated to reducing food waste. On this website, users can:

    **Share surplus food** - Have extra food? Share it here with those in need.

    **Find nearby food** - Check what food is available for pickup in your area.

    **Manage restaurant inventory** - Restaurants can manage soon-to-expire food and offer it to those in need.
